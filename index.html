                                experience traders know, trading involves a lot of risks and emotion. As human we tend

                                to not act in the best interest when we are emotional/anxious/stress. Therefore, having

                                the AI making the trade will cut out the emotion and will act rationally as the market

                                moon or crashed. In additional XAI seek to pool investors’ money together to trade as

                                one active account which can further reduces the risks. Many new investors tend to have

                                limited funds and blowup their accounts (i.e., account goes to ZERO) or get emotional

                                and sell at a lost. XAI will also allow small investors to take part in the growth where

                                he/she can invest in the pool for as little as a $1 or as much as hundreds of thousands.

                        investors with a great rate of return. On average the AI bot rate of return is around 5-10% each

                                    XAI have 2 additional AI Bots that can help further increase the rate of return. We

                                    intend to grow XAI portfolio as a portfolio of different AI Bot that will trade

                                    various markets thus the ROI will continue to increase over time. </p>

                                <p><b>Manage High Networth Individual Accounts</b></p>

                                <p>XAI will also work with high networth individuals ($500k+ in assets or $100k readily

                                    available to open the trade account) to help set up and manage these individuals

                                    accounts and in return will earn a commission based on an agreed rate of the total

                                    profits. No profits no commission guaranteed. This will further increase revenue

                                    streams for XAI foundation. </p>

                            we have researched to find the best AI for automated trading that provides the best ROI.

                            This offering is meant to further expand the reach to individuals and our objective is to

                            help lift people off poverty through investing. We recognize that trading is not meant for

                            everyone and thus look to AI to solve this problem. Anyone can be involved and joined XAI

                            via this unique project and will continue to earn income. Also, they will have the

                            opportunities for a great investment return as XAI token appreciate over the years along

                        Investors will need to stake their XAI token on our website. Each month our automated software

                        will capture the total number of wallets that staked and the total number of coins in each

                        wallet. Then the 20% profits from the trading account will be split out among the stakers based

                        on the total amount of XAI he/she staked vs the total XAI staked. Profit sharing will be

                        distributed in XAI tokens for the equivalent dollar amount (i.e., XAI current price is .20 cent

                        and profit sharing is $1, then the investor will receive 5 XAI tokens). </div>

                        To prevent people from gaming the system (i.e., buy and stake XAI on the day of the snapshot and

                        turn around to sell after receiving the profit share), our software will compare current month

                        snapshot vs last month’s snapshot. If your wallet/account was not in the last month’s snapshot,

                        then you will not qualify for the profit sharing. </div>
